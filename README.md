# Micah Bry Portfolio

This is the static portfolio site for Micah Bry, hosted at [micahbry.dev](https://micahbry.dev).

## Contents

- `index.html` — Main homepage (terminal-style interactive portfolio)
- `resume.pdf` — Primary resume (PDF)
- `resume-2026-update.pdf` — Updated resume (PDF)

## Usage

- Open `index.html` for the interactive portfolio experience.
- Resume links are available via the "links" command in the terminal UI, or directly at:
  - `/resume.pdf`
  - `/resume-2026-update.pdf`

## Manual Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

1. Upload the folder containing `index.html`, `resume.pdf`, and `resume-2026-update.pdf` to Cloudflare Pages (manual upload).
2. Ensure `index.html` is at the root of the upload folder.
3. After deploy, verify:
   - Homepage: `https://micahbry.dev/`
   - Resume: `https://micahbry.dev/resume.pdf`
   - Updated Resume: `https://micahbry.dev/resume-2026-update.pdf`

## Common Issues

- **404 at `/`**: Make sure `index.html` is at the root of the upload.
- **Resume link 404**: Ensure the PDF is uploaded and named correctly.
- **Nested folder issue**: Upload the folder's contents, not the folder itself.
